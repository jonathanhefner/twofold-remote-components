# twofold-remote-components

This is a collection of demos for React remote components.  These demos are copied from [next-remote-components](https://github.com/jonathanhefner/next-remote-components), and have been slightly modified to target the [Twofold framework](https://twofoldframework.com/).  See the [next-remote-components README](https://github.com/jonathanhefner/next-remote-components/blob/main/README.md) for more information.

To see the demos in action, clone this repo, run `pnpm run dev`, and visit http://localhost:3000/.
